# Lottery Number Prediction Project

## Overview

The **Lottery Number Prediction Project** is a comprehensive suite of machine learning and statistical models designed to analyze historical lottery data and predict future winning numbers. Leveraging a variety of algorithms, this project aims to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within past draws to enhance the accuracy of predictions.

## Features

- **Diverse Prediction Models:** Implements multiple prediction algorithms, including:
  - Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
  - Genetic Algorithms (GA)
  - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
  - Sparse Representation
  - LightGBM Regression
  - Linear Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks (LSTM, etc.)
  - And many more...

- **Modular Architecture:** Each prediction method is encapsulated within its own module, allowing for easy integration, testing, and expansion.

- **Data Handling:** Efficiently retrieves and preprocesses historical lottery data from the database for analysis.

- **Extensibility:** Easily add new prediction algorithms or modify existing ones to experiment with different approaches.

- **Logging and Debugging:** Incorporates logging and debugging tools to monitor model performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Django Framework**
- **Database:** Ensure your database is set up and configured correctly in Django settings.
